            <h3>Facts of <span>vegetables!!!</span></h3>
            <p>
                Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original
                meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant
                matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternate definition of the
                term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods
                derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits
                such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.

                Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in
                several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural
                way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went
                on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are
                grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in
                less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural
                products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production
                varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with
                vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop
                is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.
