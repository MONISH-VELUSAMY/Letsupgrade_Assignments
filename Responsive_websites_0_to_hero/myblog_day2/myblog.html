     <h2>Early Days...</h2>
    <p  class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from
        purpose-built administrative and production facilities opened in 2003 across from the historic Goodwood Circuit
        in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Limited is the exclusive manufacturer
        of Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003.

        Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has
        no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles produced prior to 2003 other than being a major engine
        and other supplier prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor
        to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars
        between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the
        Rolls-Royce brand.

        The Rolls-Royce Phantom four-door sedan was the first product offered for sale in 2003. Since then, the company
        has expanded its product line to include extended wheelbase, two-door coupé, and convertible versions of the
        Phantom Sedan, as well as the smaller Ghost four-door sedan, Wraith two-door coupé, Dawn Convertible, and the
        Cullinan SUV.</p>
